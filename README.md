Welcome to the CaddyShack!

To get started run the following in your terminal:

  - bundle install
  - rails db:migrate
  - rails db:seed
  - rails s

In a seperate terminal window, run the following:
  - cd client
  - npm install
  - npm start


Now that both the servers are up and running, you can login to application with one of the users created from the seed data:

  * CaddyShack has a couple of users with some golf statistics created from the seed data and can be viewed with the following credentials:

    * username: ryanadams
    * password: password

    * username: coleman
    * password: password


Or you can create a new user an start playing some rounds!

Please let me know what you think about this application and feel free to give feedback. I am currently still working on adding features to this application like the ability to add coursese so that users don't have to travel to Oklahoma or Georgia to utilize this application. This is one of my first apps and I am still working on cleaning up/optimizing.
